# NLP - In Progress

If git cannot render the jupyter notebook, then please visit https://www.gitmemory.com/issue/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/11/495349877 for the following instruction to see my file:

Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/tanwaz/Predicting-a-Pulsar-Star/blob/master/Predict%20PULSAR.ipynb") 

This site nbviewer works independently of github.

If some notebook rendered in nbviewer appears different from rendered in github, then append "?flush_cache=true" to the end of the nbviewer version url to force it to rerender.
